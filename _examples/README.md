# DDP Simple Demo App

The simple app demonstrates the features of the DDP library. Our app assumes you have the Meteor "Simple Todos" tutorial running in development mode with the tutorial at least to [Step 9 - Publications](https://github.com/meteor/blaze-tutorial/tree/master/src/simple-todos/step09). The Meteor app should implement user logins, methods, and publications and our app exercises all these features using DDP. The code assumes there is a user with the default user credentials from the tutorial (user `meteorite` password `password`) but feel free to adjust the code to match whatever users are in your app.

For the quickest start/test, follow these steps:

Go to [Meteor tutorial GitHub](https://github.com/meteor/blaze-tutorial) and click on the "Code" button, select "Download Zip". Once downloaded, unzip the code file, open a command line in the base of the unzipped contents and `cd src/simple-todos/step09` then type `meteor` to run the app. If the tutorial crashes out of the box, you may have to run `meteor update` and `meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime`, then `meteor`, in order to fix the crashes. Once running, in a separate command line, clone this ddp repository and cd into the root of the repo, and run `go run ./_examples`. You will see the app logs and if you have a web page open to the Meteor server you will see the task created when the simple demo app calls the `tasks.insert` method.
